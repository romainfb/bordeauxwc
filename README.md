BordeauxWC is a student project designed by Romain F and Yanis S, two B3 development students at Sup de Vinci Bordeaux. This site is the result of a project in our **versioning course**, aimed at applying our theoretical knowledge in a practical context. BordeauxWC uses Bordeaux MÃ©tropole's open API to list the city's public sanitation facilities.
